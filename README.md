# <span class="skinny">Mailsac</span> is a disposable email inbox

<br />

## what exactly is mailsac?
Mailsac is a free [open source](https://github.com/ruffrey/mailsac) email inbox service that accepts all mail that gets sent to it. All mail is regularly deleted at a specified period of time.

## how do I use mailsac?
Give out any email address you can think of *@mailsac.com* and you can instantly receive mail anonymously there.

No need to sign up or set anything up.

## why would I use mailsac?
Any time you need a temporary email address, just make one up *@mailsac.com*

- if you need an email address but do not want to receive spam in your personal inbox
- use it for sign ups on web sites that force you to log in
- give it out to strangers
- use it to collaborate for projects
- send mail to mailsac for testing purposes
- use it when you (legally) want to receive email without disclosing your identity
- it is perfect if you want an email address or multiple addresses and do not want to sign up for them

### how long is email saved?
Email messages are saved for somewhere between 1 week or more and three days, sometimes less. I make no guarantees but it should pretty much always be more than a day!

### can I use mailsac.com to host email for my domain, such as example.com?
Heck yes! Just set up your DNS settings for MX to point to *mailsac.com* - <a href="http://mailsac.com/domainsetup">more info here</a>.

### how do I reply to my mailsac emails?
You cannot reply to mailsac emails. Mailsac is a receive-only inbox.

### where are my email attachments?
Attachments are never saved.

### why are my emails not coming through?
The maximum email address prefix (the *junky-face* in *junky-face@mailsac.com*) length is 25 characters. Also, please make sure the email address conforms to typical standards. Most Unicode characters should work, but I only tested English letters.
Another possibility is that the incoming email was marked as spam. Mailsac has relatively mild spam filters, but your messages might be getting caught.

### can I setup my own mailsac?
Yep, just go to the [open source project](https://github.com/ruffrey/mailsac), update the config.js file, and you're good to go!

You can use your own Mailsac for testing or email hosting, or something.

Mailsac just asks that you link back to us and don't steal our name.

### how do I report a bug or request a feature?
Use the [GitHub issues feature on the Mailsac GitHub page](https://github.com/ruffrey/mailsac/issues).
